---

## Overview

Here are the [kintone UI Component v1.0.0](https://github.com/kintone-labs/kintone-ui-component/releases/tag/v1.0.0) Release Notes.  
This section explains the background of the update from v0 to v1 and the future plans.

## Background

In v0, we have received a variety of requests, and we have responded to those request with additional components and functionalities.
For those engineers who are developing kintone customization, we have added features to make the experience to develop kintone-like parts easier. Please find the following to learn more about our renewed v1.

<!--truncate-->

- Response to feature requests from v0 users
- Specification/function consideration with specific use cases
- Review the complexity of the design and the function
- Lighter internal implementation

## Update details

The major updates are as follows:

- Improved the reproducibility of kintone parts
  - The UI and behavior are closer to the kintone parts.
- Enabled accessibility
  - Added support for keyboard operation and voice-to-speech software.
- Enabled mobile
  - We have provided mobile components since we have received a lot of request.
- Improved the reference
  - The reference page for each part is easier to view. (UI view, sample code)
  - Japanese supported.

## Considerations during development

This section explains the points of the update that were taken into account during the development process.

- Inherit the interface basically and reduces the learning cost.
  - This was put into consideration as we do not want the v0 users to experience a significant amount of change.

1. v1.0.0
```JavaScript
    const button = new Kuc.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
      id: 'kuc_button' // Add id property
    });
    header.appendChild(button);　// Show button
```
2. v0.7.4
```JavaScript
    const button = new kintoneUIComponent.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
    });
    header.appendChild(button.render());　// Show button
```

- Improved the usage of the property, rather than the invocation of the method.
  - To make this feature simple to use, you can now set the property without having to call the method.

1. v1.0.0
```JavaScript
    const button = new Kuc.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
      id: 'kuc_button'
    });
    header.appendChild(button);
    button.text = 'Register'; // Update text property
```
2. v0.7.4
```JavaScript
    const button = new kintoneUIComponent.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
    });
    header.appendChild(button.render());
    button.setText('Register'); // Update text property
```

- Compressed and implemented the functions that are actually used in kintone customization.
  - Implemented components and functions with specific use cases. (Including what was not provided in kintone standard function)
  - In contract, we have excluded the development of components that we have considered to have fewer use cases. (If there is a use case, the correspondence will be considered. We are looking forward to your feedback on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kintone-labs/kintone-ui-component/issues/new/choose).）
    - Attachment, ColorPicker, FieldGroup, IconButton, Tab, React ver.

- Implemented with the LitElement of the Web Components framework to improve readability of internal code.
  - Instead of implementing only in JavaScript, we aimed to improve the quality of internal code by implementing with the framework.
  - The Web Components interface will be considered in the future.

With the above, we aimed to provide components that are easier to use than v0 and are aligned with the actual kintone customization use cases.
Please refer to the following [this article](https://kintone-ui-component.netlify.app/docs/guides/comparison-v0-v1) for the details of differences between v0 and v1.

## Future plans

The following are the plans for the upcoming v1:

- Provide additional components
  - Additional components such as Table, ReadOnlyTable, Dialog, Date, and DateTime are expected to be provided.
- Provide mobile components
- Prepare for samples and tutorials for a more practical use.
  - We will increase the sample code and the tutorial article according to the use case.

> In the case of v0, we will continue to fix bugs and update the libraries. However, new feature development is not part of the roadmap as of now.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading till the end.
kintone UI Component v1 is a library designed to provide convenience for engineers who are involved in kintone customization and plug-in development.
Please stay tuned for further releasing note.
