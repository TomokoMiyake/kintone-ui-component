## Overview

[kintone UI Component v1.0.0](https://github.com/kintone-labs/kintone-ui-component/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  Release Notes.  
This section explains the background of the update from v0 to v1 and the future plans.

## Background

In v0, we received various requests, and added the supported components and functions.
The kintone-like part of the engineers who are customizing Kintone this time is more "Easily"  In order to be able to create this feature, the following examination will be renewed as v1.

<!--truncate-->

- v0 response to feature requests from users
- Specification/function study with specific use cases
- The design and the functional complexity are reviewed
- Leaner internal implementation

## Update details

The major updates are as follows:

- Improving the fidelity of kintone parts
  -  The UI and behavior of the kintone parts are closer to each other.
- Accessibility enabled
  - Added support for keyboard operation and voice-to-speech software.
- Mobile Enabled
  - We have provided mobile components with a lot of requests.
- Reference improvements
  - The reference page for each part is easy to view. (UI view, sample code)
  - Japanese supported.

## Considerations during development

This section explains the points of the update that were taken into account during the development process.

- The interface is a basic succession and reduces the learning cost.
  - This was considered not to be a significant change in the sense of use from v0.

1. v1.0.0
```JavaScript
    const button = new Kuc.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
      id: 'kuc_button' // Add id property
    });
    header.appendChild(button);　// Show button
```
2. v0.7.4
```JavaScript
    const button = new kintoneUIComponent.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
    });
    header.appendChild(button.render());　// Show button
```

- Improved the usage of the property, rather than the invocation of the method.
  - This feature is simple to use, so that you can set the property by quitting its own method.

1. v1.0.0
```JavaScript
    const button = new Kuc.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
      id: 'kuc_button'
    });
    header.appendChild(button);
    button.text = 'Register'; // Update text property
```
2. v0.7.4
```JavaScript
    const button = new kintoneUIComponent.Button({
      type: 'submit',
      text: 'Search',
    });
    header.appendChild(button.render());
    button.setText('Register'); // Update text property
```

- Implemented in the kintone customization by using the actual function.
  - Implemented components and functions with specific use cases. (Not included in kintone standard function)
  - On the other hand, we have seen the development of components deemed scarce by the use cases. (If there is a use case, the correspondence will be considered.[GitHub issue](https://github.com/kintone-labs/kintone-ui-component/issues/new/choose)  We are looking forward to your feedback. ）
    - Attachment, ColorPicker, FieldGroup, IconButton, Tab, React ver.

- Implemented in the LitElement of the Web Components framework to improve readability of internal code.
  - Instead of implementing only JavaScript, we aimed to improve the quality of internal code by implementing frameworks.
  - The WebComponents interface will be considered in the future.

With the above, we aimed to provide components that are easier to use than v0 and are aligned with the actual kintone customization use cases.
For differences in the writing of v0 and v1[Here](https://kintone-ui-component.netlify.app/docs/guides/comparison-v0-v1)  So we explain in the article, please confirm the details.

## Future plans

The following are the plans for the upcoming v1:

- Add part
  - Additional components such as Table, ReadOnlyTable, Dialog, Date, and DateTime are expected to be provided.
- Add Mobile Enabled Components
- Preparing samples and tutorials for a more practical use
  - We will increase the sample code and the tutorial article according to the use case.

> In the case of v0, the main problem is fixed and the library update is continued. New feature development is not currently planned.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading till the end.
kintone UI Component v1 is designed to be a convenient library for engineers who are involved in kintone customization and plug-in development.
Please stay tuned in the future.
